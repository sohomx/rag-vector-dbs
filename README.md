1. Spotify Annoy:

## Execution

- The script loads a pre-trained sentence transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- Embeddings are generated for a set of provided paragraphs using this model.
- An Annoy index is built to efficiently search for nearest neighbors based on these embeddings.
- A sample query sentence is simulated, and its nearest neighbors within the paragraph embeddings are retrieved.

## Results Display

The script displays the query sentence and its nearest neighbors from the provided list of paragraphs, along with their distances.

## Notes

- This code is designed to showcase how to generate sentence embeddings using `SentenceTransformer` and create an `Annoy` index for efficient nearest neighbor searches.
- It demonstrates the process of finding semantically similar paragraphs based on their embeddings.

## Credits

This Python script utilizes the following libraries:

- `SentenceTransformer`: Utilized for generating sentence embeddings.
- `Annoy`: Employed to build an efficient index for nearest neighbor searches.
